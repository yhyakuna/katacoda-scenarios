This tutorial uses [Vault docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/vault/) which is running Vault in development mode.

## Login to Vault

When Vault is running in development mode, it runs entirely in-memory and starts unsealed with a single unseal key. The root token is already authenticated to the CLI, so you can immediately begin using Vault.

First, get the generated root token.

> Enter the following command into the terminal, or click on the command (`⮐`) to automatically copy it into the terminal and execute it.

```
docker logs vault > system.out
grep 'Root Token:' system.out | awk '{print $NF}' > root_token.txt
```{{execute}}

Login with root token:

```
vault login $(cat root_token.txt)
```{{execute}}

#### Now, you are ready to start writing Vault policies!
