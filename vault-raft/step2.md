Click the **+** next to the opened Terminal, and select **Open New Terminal** to start third terminal (**Terminal 3**).

Open the `node2` server configuration file, `config-node2.hcl`{{open}}.

```
storage "raft" {
  path    = "/home/scrapbook/tutorial/raft-node2/"
  node_id = "node2"
}

listener "tcp" {
  address = "127.0.0.1:2200"
  cluster_address = "127.0.0.1:2201"
  tls_disable = true
}

disable_mlock = true
api_addr = "http://127.0.0.1:2200"
cluster_addr = "http://127.0.0.1:2201"
```

Notice that the `node_id` is set to `node2` and this server will listen to port **`2200`**.

Execute the following command to start `node2`:

```
mkdir raft-node2
vault server -config=config-node2.hcl
```{{execute T3}}

```
==> Vault server configuration:

             Api Address: http://127.0.0.1:2200
                     Cgo: disabled
         Cluster Address: https://127.0.0.1:2201
              Listener 1: tcp (addr: "127.0.0.1:2200", cluster address: "127.0.0.1:2201", max_request_duration: "1m30s", max_request_size: "33554432", tls: "disabled")
               Log Level: info
                   Mlock: supported: true, enabled: false
                 Storage: raft (HA available)
                 Version: Vault v1.2.2

==> Vault server started! Log data will stream in below:
```

You can verify that the **Api Address** is `http://127.0.0.1:2200`.

## Join the Cluster

Click the **+** next to the opened Terminal, and select **Open New Terminal** to start fourth terminal (**Terminal 4**).

![](https://education-yh.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/katacoda-images/katacoda-terminal.png)


In **Terminal 4**, set the VAULT_ADDR to `http://127.0.0.1:2200`.

```
export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:2200'
```{{execute T4}}

Check the `node2` server status:

```
vault status
```{{execute T4}}

```
Key                Value
---                -----
Seal Type          shamir
Initialized        false
Sealed             true
Total Shares       0
Threshold          0
Unseal Progress    0/0
Unseal Nonce       n/a
Version            n/a
HA Enabled         true
```

Now, you are going to use `vault operator raft` command to join `node2` to `node1` Raft cluster.  Execute the `vault operator raft join` command.

```
vault operator raft join http://127.0.0.1:8200
```{{execute T4}}

Where `http://127.0.0.1:8200` is the API address of `node1`.

```
Key       Value
---       -----
Joined    true
```

Check the `node2` server status again.

```
vault status
```{{execute T4}}

```
Key                Value
---                -----
Seal Type          shamir
Initialized        true
Sealed             true
Total Shares       1
Threshold          1
Unseal Progress    0/1
Unseal Nonce       n/a
Version            1.2.2
HA Enabled         true
```

Notice that the `node2` status is now initialized and ready to be unsealed using the unseal key generated by the **active** server (`node1`).

> **NOTE:** By joining the cluster, `node2` becomes the **standby** node.  

```
vault operator unseal $(grep 'Key 1:' key.txt | awk '{print $NF}')
```{{execute T4}}

Once Vault is unsealed, you can login using the root token.

```
vault login $(grep 'Initial Root Token:' key.txt | awk '{print $NF}')
```{{execute T4}}

Check the Raft cluster configuration.

```
vault operator raft configuration -format=json
```{{execute T4}}

```
{
  ...
  "data": {
    "config": {
      "index": 51,
      "servers": [
        {
          "address": "127.0.0.1:8201",
          "leader": true,
          "node_id": "node1",
          "protocol_version": "3",
          "voter": true
        },
        {
          "address": "127.0.0.1:2201",
          "leader": false,
          "node_id": "node2",
          "protocol_version": "3",
          "voter": true
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  ...
```

You should see both `node1` and `node2` listed.

At this point, you have two-node cluster.  Let's continue and add `node3` to this cluster.
