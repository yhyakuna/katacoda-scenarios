WARNING! dev mode is enabled! In this mode, Vault runs entirely in-memory
and starts unsealed with a single unseal key. The root token is already
authenticated to the CLI, so you can immediately begin using Vault.
```

When Vault is running in development mode, it runs entirely in-memory that the data does not get **persisted**. This build-in, pre-configured server is useful for local development, testing and exploration.
