In the output, locate `secret/` and check its version.

```
Path          Type         ...    Options           Description
----          ----         ...    -------           -----------
cubbyhole/    cubbyhole    ...    map[]             per-token private secret storage
identity/     identity     ...    map[]             identity store
secret/       kv           ...    map[version:2]    key/value secret storage
sys/          system       ...    map[]             system endpoints used for control, policy and debugging
```
